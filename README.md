Lab 1: Sampling and Reconstruction of Speech Signals
This lab demonstrates the process of sampling a speech signal at different rates and reconstructing it using various interpolation methods. The workflow includes:
Reading and normalizing a speech audio file.
Sampling the signal at multiple rates (8 kHz, 16 kHz, 44.1 kHz).
Reconstructing the signal using zero-order hold, linear, and cubic interpolation.
Visualizing the original, sampled, and reconstructed waveforms.
Evaluating reconstruction quality using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Playing back the audio to compare perceptual quality.
This lab helps understand fundamental digital signal processing concepts, including discretization, interpolation, and the effect of sampling rate on signal quality.

Lab 2: Fourier Transform and Frequency Spectrum Analysis
This lab focuses on analyzing signals in both time and frequency domains using DTFT and DFT.
Generated signals: sinusoidal, composite, exponential decay, and rectangular pulse.
Plotted time-domain waveforms to visualize signal behavior over time.
Computed DTFT and DFT to study frequency components.
Observed how signal characteristics affect spectral content:
Sinusoids → single frequency peak
Composite → multiple peaks
Exponential → broad spectrum
Rectangular pulse → sinc-shaped spectrum
This lab helps understand fundamental signal analysis concepts used in DSP, communications, and audio processing.
